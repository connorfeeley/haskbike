# Toronto Bike Share Historical Data Explorer

**README is incomplete: [my
blog](https://cfeeley.org/city-stuff/freedom-of-information/) for a
series of posts about this.**

I started collecting station-level data from Toronto's Bike Share API so
that I could get a historical view of the system's usage. I've been
collecting data about every station in the network roughly every 30s,
since September 24th, 2023.

This project was borne out of my frustration for why Wellesley Station
has had a complement of at least 9 - often more - disabled e-bikes ever
since the station was converted to a charging station a few months ago

## *The Frustration*

I think Toronto's Bike Share program is, for the most part, a fairly
well-run program and a stunningly good value-for-money proposition for
both users as well as for the city.

Those of us who think the system is great, and who therefore use the
system regularly, are also probably dearly familiar with with the ways
in with the system is *not* great.

Depending on the time of day and how close you are to the core, your
local station probably spends most of it's time (nearly) full or
(nearly) empty.

E-Bikes - though dramatically more common now than earlier than even
just this year (which is great!) - seem to be disabled whenever you want
to use one.

The limited number of charging stations doesn't help much: [see
list](https://bikes.cfeeley.org/visualization/station-list?station-type=Charging).
